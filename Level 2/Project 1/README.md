# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using **Linear Regression** to estimate house prices based on various numerical features. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Dataset
Housing Price Dataset from Kaggle.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature selection
- Data splitting (training and testing)
- Linear Regression model implementation
- Model evaluation using performance metrics
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices

## Model Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared score

## Key Insights
- Certain features strongly influence house prices
- Linear regression provides good baseline prediction accuracy
- Model performance improves with proper feature selection

## Outcome
This project enhanced my understanding of supervised learning, regression models, and model evaluation techniques in machine learning.
