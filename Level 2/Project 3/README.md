# Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics

## Objective
To analyze and implement autocomplete and autocorrect techniques using structured data for improved user experience.

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Kaggle.
Dataset link- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Approach
Since the dataset does not contain text, feature names were used as input text to demonstrate autocomplete and autocorrect functionality.

## Steps Performed
- Dataset exploration
- Feature name preprocessing
- Autocomplete algorithm implementation
- Autocorrect logic implementation
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## Key Insights
- Autocomplete improves typing efficiency
- Autocorrect reduces user input errors
- Even structured datasets can support text-based analytics

## Outcome
Developed analytical thinking and applied NLP concepts creatively.
